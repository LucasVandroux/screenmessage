Goal
---------

The purpose of this PDC project is to complement the theory with a hands-onexperience.  What you do in this project is not very different from what a communication engineer might do to test the feasibility of a concept.

Assignment
------------

Develop a proof of concept to show that we can exchange files "over the air" between two laptops, by using the display of one laptop as the transmitting deviceand the camera of the other laptop as the receiving device.

Rules and Recommendations
----------------------------

1. You  work  in  a  team  of  two.   You  have  one  week  from  the  assignment  date  to  an-nounce  your  partner  (in  class  or  via  email  to  francoise.behn@epfl.ch  with  subject PDC project).  Groups that are not formed by then will be formed by the teaching staff.

2. By default, all the code has to be written by the team members.  We are open to thepossibility of using a piece of external code if that leads to a particularly interestingsolution, but the use of external code has to be approved by the professor.  Approvedexternal code is announced in class and can be used by everyone.

3. We recommend that you use MATLAB as the programming language.

4. During the last week of class, each group presents their project in a few minutes andgives a demonstration by transmitting a file that we provide (one sentence in bits).

5. Reliability plays the most important role in the evaluation. Hopefully the communication  will  be  error-free.   The  data  rate  and  the  implementation  details  play  asecondary role.  Decoding need not be real-time, i.e., you can sample and store thereceived signal and process afterwards.

Note
-------

This project is meant to be instructive and enjoyable.  It accounts only for  15%  ofthe points that you can accumulate towards yourfinnal grade. Do not let it become a majortime investment unless you can fford to do so.  In particular,  we strongly recommendthat you do not let the project keep you from completing the other assignments, all ofwhich are important to do well on the final exam.
